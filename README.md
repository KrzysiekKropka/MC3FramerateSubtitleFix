# Usage

1.  Place ASSETS.DAT or the decoded ASSETS folder extracted from Midnight Club 3 DUB Edition's ISO (preferably DUB Edition Remix (USA))

2.  Run the script.

3.  Back in primary school, I used to take a shit and draw pentagrams with it on walls for fun. Teachers never found out who was the culprit.

4.  Decode ASSETS.DAT if you're running the script for the first time.
    If you already decoded it before and ran the script, it will tell you that "The timecodes are already fixed." and you can choose to restore the timecode values to default.

6.  Encode ASSETS.DAT, then replace the original file in the folder containing the extracted contents of Midnight Club 3's ISO. 
    Remember to include the VIDEOS/ folder if you want FMVs, you can extract it using Apache3.
    Burn the folder contents into an ISO (you can use ImgBurn for this)
